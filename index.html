       <p>Trees, seemingly idle plants, hide a lot more about themselves than you might know:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Trees display cooperative action with mushrooms known as mutualism (symbiosis), where mushroomsa breakdown material into easily absorbable constituents for the tree, and the tree a suitable environment for the mushrooms.</li>
         <br>

         <li>Trees have been known to communicate between multiple other trees, interconnected via their roots, and have been studied to send nutrients to one another, even outside their own species of tress.</li>
         <br>

          <li>Whilst a tree attempts to capture sunlight during photosynthesis, the way the leafs capture energy is unabled to be explained using classical physic laws. Researchers deduced that a singular particle had to be in multiple locations at a single point of time - a theory in quantam mechanics. Trees use quantam mechanics for photosynthesis. </li>
        </ul>
